                    <h1>About Us</h1>

                    <h3>What is Theta Tau?</h3>
                    <p>Theta Tau is the oldest, largest, and foremost fraternity for engineers. Since its founding at the University of Minnesota in 1904, over 30,000 men and women have been initiated. With emphasis on quality and a strong fraternal bond, the Fraternity has chapters only at ABET-accredited schools. Within each chapter, the Fraternity stimulates professional activity and social compatibility; provides a framework for group participation in campus, community, engineering, and fraternity affairs; and promotes lasting friendships -- a lifetime of brotherhood in an engineering environment.</p>

                    <h4>Purpose</h4>
                    <p>The purpose of Theta Tau is to develop and maintain a high standard of professional interest among its members, and to unite them in a strong bond of fraternal fellowship.</p>

                    <h4>Mission</h4>
                    <p>The mission of Theta Tau is to develop engineering leaders for Service, Brotherhood, and Profession.</p>

                    <h4>For our Community</h4>
                    <p>We are known for our service to our college, university, and the larger community. Our service projects create a unifying environment for learning and personal growth for our members.</p>

                    <h4>For Profession</h4>
                    <p>We develop and nurture engineers with strong communication, problem-solving, collaboration, and leadership skills that we demonstrate in our profession, our community, and in our lives. Study groups formed of members in the same classes are common in our chapter.</p>

                    <h4>For Brotherhood</h4>
                    <p>We forge lifelong bonds of fraternal friendship, a journey that develops and delivers a network of lasting personal and professional relationships. We foster an inviting, safe, and social environment in which our members often become lifelong friends.
                    The Psi Beta Chapter of Theta Tau, established at the University of Texas at Austin in 1991, is a diverse, energetic group of about seventy engineering students engaged in a wide variety of social, campus, professional development, and community service activities.</p>

                    <h3>How Do I Join?</h3>
                    <p>To be eligible for membership in our chapter, a current engineering student at the University of Texas must rush and subsequently pledge.</p>

                    <h3>What is Rush?</h3>
                    <p><a href="rush.html">Rush</a> is a two-week period at the start of each semester during which Theta Tau recruits potential members. During Rush there are several on-campus information sessions during which prospective pledges are introduced to members of the chapter and invited to ask questions about the fraternity and the pledging process. There are also weekly social events designed to give "rushees" further insight into the chapter and meet active members to find out if Theta Tau is for them. There is NO obligation to pledge if you attend rush events.</p>

                    <h3>What is Pledging?</h3>
                    <p>Professional fraternities such as Theta Tau are characterized by their commitment to high professional ethics and the bond of fraternal fellowship. The Pledge Semester is a time when prospective members ("pledges") are educated in the purpose, history, and traditions of the Fraternity. The Pledge Semester is also a fun time to meet new friends and learn about the gears that keep the Fraternity running. At the end of the semester, those who have distinguished themselves are invited to become members.</p>

                    <h3>What are the requirements of pledging?</h3>
                    <p>During the pledge period, pledges are expected to: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be in good academic standing with the University.</li>
                        <li>Get to know the active members.</li>
                        <li>Attend weekly pledge meetings.</li>
                        <li>Attend Theta Tau events.</li>
                        <li>Pay a one-time pledging fee (less than one-tenth of that required by some Greek Fraternities and Sororities).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How much time does Theta Tau require from me?</h3>
                    <p>We have events throughout the week and on the weekends. Events are not mandatory, but you'll find that the more time you put into Theta Tau the more you can personally get out of it. Your level of participation is a personal decision.</p>

                    <h3>Does Theta Tau haze?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely not. The Fraternity's overall commitment to professionalism and fellowship strongly forbids all forms of dangerous or degrading activities which fall into the category of "hazing." Theta Tau’s members will not force pledges to do anything that goes against their personal beliefs or general habits.</p>

                    <h3>Is Theta Tau an honor society?</h3>
                    <p>No. Although we encourage academic achievement, the minimum GPA is to be in good standing with the University, which is 2.00.</p>


                    <h3>How do you pronounce the "Tau" in "Theta Tau"?</h3>
                    <p>In physics or math classes, "Tau" rhymes with "how" or "cow." However, because “Tau” comes after “Theta” in our name, "Tau" rhymes with "saw" or "law."</p>
